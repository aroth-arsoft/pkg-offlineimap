Description: IMAP/Maildir synchronization and reader support
 OfflineIMAP is a tool to simplify your e-mail reading.  With
 OfflineIMAP, you can:
 .
  * Read the same mailbox from multiple computers, and have your
    changes (deletions, etc.) be automatically reflected on
    all computers
 .
  * Use various mail clients to read a single mail box
 .
  * Read mail while offline (on a laptop) and have all changes
    synchronized when you get connected again
 .
  * Read IMAP mail with mail readers that do not support IMAP
 .
  * Use SSL (secure connections) to read IMAP mail even if your reader
    doesn't support SSL
 .
  * Synchronize your mail using a completely safe and fault-tolerant
    algorithm.
 .
  * Customize which mailboxes to synchronize with regular expressions
    or lists.
 .
  * Synchronize your mail two to four times faster than with other tools
    or other mail readers' internal IMAP support.
 .
 In short, OfflineIMAP is a tool to let you read mail how YOU want to.
