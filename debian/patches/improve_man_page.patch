 KNOWN BUGS
 ==========
 
-* SSL3 write pending:
-    users enabling SSL may hit a bug about "SSL3 write pending". If so, the
-    account(s) will stay unsynchronised from the time the bug appeared. Running
-    OfflineIMAP again can help. We are still working on this bug.  Patches or
-    detailed bug reports would be appreciated. Please check you're running the
-    last stable version and send us a report to the mailing list including the
-    full log.
-
-* IDLE support is incomplete and experimental.  Bugs may be encountered.
-
-  * No hook exists for "run after an IDLE response".  Email will
-    show up, but may not be processed until the next refresh cycle.
-
-  * nametrans may not be supported correctly.
-
-  * IMAP IDLE <-> IMAP IDLE doesn't work yet.
-
-  * IDLE may only work "once" per refresh.  If you encounter this bug,
-    please send a report to the list!
-
-* Maildir support in Windows drive
-    Maildir uses colon caracter (:) in message file names. Colon is however
-    forbidden character in windows drives. There are several workarounds for
-    that situation:
-
-   * Use "maildir-windows-compatible = yes" account OfflineIMAP configuration.
-      - That makes OfflineIMAP to use exclamation mark (!) instead of colon for
-        storing messages. Such files can be written to windows partitions. But
-        you will probably loose compatibility with other programs trying to
-        read the same Maildir.
-      - Exclamation mark was chosen because of the note in
-        http://docs.python.org/library/mailbox.html
-      - If you have some messages already stored without this option, you will
-        have to re-sync them again
