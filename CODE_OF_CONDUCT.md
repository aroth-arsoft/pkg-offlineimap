# Realistic Code of Conduct

1. We mostly care about making our softwares better.

2. Everybody is free to decide how to contribute.

3. Free speech owns to anyone of us.

4. Feel offended? This might be very well-deserved.

5. We don't need a code of conduct imposed on us, thanks.

6. Ignoring this Realistic Code of Conduct is welcome.
